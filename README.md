# DeepDetect
ImageVerifier is a lightweight and efficient deep learning web application that detects whether an image is real or fake using the ShuffleNetV2 architecture.  This project combines a pre-trained CNN model with a simple drag-and-drop interface built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flask, making it easy to use even for non-technical users.
